# Java Practice Repository â€“ 1st Year of DAM

This repository contains Java exercises and projects developed during my **first year of the Multiplatform Application Development (DAM) program**. It includes fundamental programming concepts, object-oriented design, file handling, and graphical user interfaces using Swing.

## Repository Structure

- `EjerciciosBasicos`: Basic exercises with operators, conditionals, loops, and arrays.
- `POO`: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism.
- `Colecciones`: Practice with Java collections such as `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, and `TreeMap`.
- `Ficheros`: Reading and writing text and binary files using Java I/O.
- `InterfacesGraficas`: Graphical interfaces created using Swing (NetBeans).
- `Proyectos`: Complete applications like budget managers, recipe organizers, attendance control, and more.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Language:** Java 17  
- **IDE:** NetBeans  
- **Libraries:** Swing, AWT  
- **Data persistence:** Binary files (`ObjectOutputStream` / `ObjectInputStream`)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and master Java syntax and basic logic.
- Apply principles of Object-Oriented Programming in practical scenarios.
- Build functional and well-structured graphical user interfaces.
- Handle persistent data storage using file I/O techniques.

## Repository Status

This repository is actively maintained and will be expanded with new exercises and improved projects as I continue my studies.
